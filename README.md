# NixOS

This repo contains NixOS configuration for my local developement VM.
It has been tested on [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM) running on M2 Apple Silcon.

### Known issues (vms)
- i3wm - broken clipboard (host <-> guest)

### TODO
- select partisions by label for vm setup
- setup macos
- share some configs between macos and vms (e.g. tmux)
